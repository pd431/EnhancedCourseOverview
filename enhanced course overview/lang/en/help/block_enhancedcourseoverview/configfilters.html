<h2>Course Filters</h2>

<p>This setting configures the filter buttons that will appear above the course list.</p>

<p>The syntax for defining filters is as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Empty lines are ignored</li>
    <li>Lines without a pipe character (|) are treated as group headers</li>
    <li>Lines with a pipe character have the format: <code>Filter Title|text_to_match</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
2023-24
Term 1|_A1_202324
Term 2|_A2_202324

2024-25
Term 1|_A1_202425
Term 2|_A2_202425
</pre>

<p>This will create two button groups:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Group "2023-24" with buttons "Term 1" and "Term 2"</li>
    <li>Group "2024-25" with buttons "Term 1" and "Term 2"</li>
</ul>

<p>When a filter button is clicked, only courses containing the specified text in their name or description will be shown.</p>
