# EnhancedCourseOverview
This plugin extends Moodle's [Course Overview plugin](https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Course_overview) and allows for custom filters to be applied to retrieved courses.

This is a proof of concept for a more user-centric interface, that surfaces relevant courses first, and an answer to the poor filtering system in core Moodle's course overview.
As it stands, the design has only gone through a few people, but with very positive feedback. Suggestions, contributions, feedback and criticism welcome.
